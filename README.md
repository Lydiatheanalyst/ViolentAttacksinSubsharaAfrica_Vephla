Introduction
The analysis of violent and terrorist attacks across six countries in West and Central Africa, with a primary focus on Nigeria, provides critical insights into the prevalence, patterns, and impacts of such incidents. This study aims to uncover key metrics and trends from the dataset, highlighting the scope and scale of the challenges faced by these nations.
Nigeria emerges as the epicenter of violence, contributing to over 80% of reported incidents, with neighboring countries such as Cameroon, Niger, and Chad also experiencing significant impacts. The years 2014 and 2015 mark a particularly dark period, with the highest number of fatalities and injuries recorded during this time. Cities like Maiduguri, which saw the most attacks, and groups like Boko Haram, responsible for the majority of casualties, stand out as critical areas of concern.
This document details the findings of the analysis, presenting a structured overview of geographic distribution, temporal trends, attack methods, targeted groups, and the role of perpetrators. By identifying key patterns and trends, the study seeks to provide actionable insights to inform security interventions, counterterrorism strategies, and regional cooperation efforts aimed at addressing these challenges.
